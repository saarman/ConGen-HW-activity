# ConGen-HW-activity  

This repository contains the EasyPop parameters used to build the simulated datasets, and two Rmarkdown files and corresponding knitted PDF files: One "teacher" version, and one "student" version. Both versions have learning goals and background information, tasks, and activity questions.
* **EasyPop-parameters.txt**: EasyPop parameters used to simulate scenarios A-D for Part 1.   
* **HW-teacher.Rmd (and .pdf) **: The "teacher" version has analysis from all four scenarios A-D for Part 1.   
* **HW-student.Rmd (and .pdf) **: The "student" version has analysis from just one of four scenarios for Part 1, and edits to the code are necessary to specify which scenario (A-D) the student is assigned.
