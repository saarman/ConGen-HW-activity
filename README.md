# ConGen-HW-activity  

This repository contains two Rmarkdown files: One "teacher" version, and one "student" version. Both versions have learning goals and background information.   
* The "teacher" version has analysis from all four scenarios.   
* The "student version has analysis from just one of four scenarios, and edits to the code are necessary to specify which scenario (A-D) the student is assigned.
