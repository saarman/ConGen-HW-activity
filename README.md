# ConGen-HW-activity  

This repository contains two Rmarkdown files: One "teacher" version, and a student version where edits to the code are necessary to specify which scenario (A-D) the student is assigned.

Both versions have learning goals and background information. The teacher version has analysis from all four scenarios. The student version has analysis from just one of four scenarios, and the student needs to fill in which scenario.
