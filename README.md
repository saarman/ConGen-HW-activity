# ConGen-HW-activity  

This repository contains two Rmarkdown files: One "teacher" version, and one "student" version. Both versions have learning goals and background information, tasks, and activity questions.
* **HW-teacher.Rmd**: The "teacher" version has analysis from all four scenarios.   
* **HW-student.Rmd**: The "student" version has analysis from just one of four scenarios, and edits to the code are necessary to specify which scenario (A-D) the student is assigned.
